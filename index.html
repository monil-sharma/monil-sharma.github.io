         <li class="forhover"><b>1856</b>- Born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire<br><p class="hidden">Nikola Tesla is believed to have been born at midnight. During his birth, lightning struck during a summer storm. Born to a Serbian Family in Smiljan, Tesla was nicknamed `Child of the Storm`, by his aunt. That said, his mother replied to that comment by calling him `Child of the light`. He was born based on the conventional Slavonic rites, and his birth records show he was born on July 28th. Tesla was the fourth child in a family of five children. The family comprised of three sisters including Marica, Angelina, Milka and his old brother who was known as Dane. Dane died when Tesla was still at a tender age. Tesla attended his early education in 1861 in Smiljan, where he acquired various skills including arithmetic and he also mastered the German Language. The following year, Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as Gospic. Here, his father played the role of a Parish Pastor.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1875</b>- Tesla enrolls in college<br><p class="hidden">In 1875, Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. He was a disciplined student and achieved the highest grades possible while passing various exams. More so, he also started a cultural club and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the Technical Department. During his second year, he got into an argument with one his professors over the functionality of the Gramme dynamo.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1880</b>- Tesla moves to Prague to study philosophy<br><p class="hidden">Tesla’s uncle collected money to help him relocate to Prague to finish his studies. He arrived late to enroll for classes, and his lack of competence in Greek and Czech meant that he did not qualify for the classes he wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in Philosophy at the university, though he did not receive grades for the courses.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1881</b>- Tesla begins his career as Chief Electrical Engineer<br><p class="hidden">In 1881, he moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph company. Upon arriving, he noticed that the Budapest Telephone Exchange company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman in another company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in operation, and he was given the position of chief electrical engineer. During his tenure, he introduced various operation upswings which improved the performance of the company.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1882</b>- Moved to Paris, France<br><p class="hidden">In 1882, he found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the Continental Edison Company. He began working in a new industry by installing indoor lighting resources. His company had several divisions, and he worked in the section of the company that was responsible for lighting systems. At this company, he improved his electrical engineering prowess. The management team noticed his abilities and soon introduced him as part of the team that would produce dynamos and motors.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1884</b>- Emigrated to the US to work for Edison<br><p class="hidden">In 1884, one of his managers from Paris was relocated to the US to manage a company where he worked. During, this time, Tesla started a manufacturing division that was found in New York and sought for Tesla to be relocated to the country as well. In the same year, Tesla was relocated to the USA and started working immediately.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1891</b>- Demonstrated wireless energy transmission<br><p class="hidden">Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling. This was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.` He tried in many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was based on near field and capacitative coupling. He even performed various public demonstrations, where he would light up Geissler tubes to impress his audience. Tesla also spent close to well over a decade trying to come up with new solutions for lighting</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1891</b>- Tesla coil is invented<br><p class="hidden">In mid 1891, at the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of the US. In the same year, he also patented his famous Tesla Coil.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1895</b>- Designed first hydroelectric power plant at Niagra Falls<br><p class="hidden">In 1895, Tesla and industrialist George Westinghouse created the world’s first hydroelectric power plant at the Niagara Falls, beating out Tesla’s rival Thomas Edison and changing the way we look at such powerful natural forces. </p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1897</b>- Patented the basis system of radio<br><p class="hidden">By early 1895, Tesla was ready to transmit a signal 50 miles to West Point, New York... But in that same year, disaster struck. A building fire consumed Tesla's lab, destroying his work. Tesla filed his basic radio patent applications in 1897. They were granted in 1900.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1899</b>- Moved to Colorado Springs, California where he did high frequency experiments<br><p class="hidden">By the end of the 1890s, Tesla had come to the conclusion that it might be possible to transmit electrical power without wires at high altitudes. There the air was thinner, and therefore more conductive. With $30,000 from Colonel John Jacob Astor, the inventor prepared at once to move to Colorado and begin building a new experimental station near Pikes Peak. Joining Tesla were several assistants who were not fully informed of the inventor's plans. Arriving at Colorado Springs in May 1899, Tesla went to inspect the acreage. It was some miles out in the prairie. He told reporters that he intended to send a radio signal from Pikes Peak to Paris, but furnished no details.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1906</b>- Demonstrated bladeless turbine<br><p class="hidden">Tesla developed it while trying to make an engine that was light enough to power his ultimate goal of building a “flying machine”. Tesla-type turbines can also be referred to as multiple-disk, friction, shear-force, or boundary layer turbomachinery.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1917</b>- Awarded Edison Medal<br><p class="hidden">Tesla was awarded the seventh Edison medal on December 13, 1916, “for meritorious achievements in his early original work in polyphase and high-frequency electric currents,” received the medal at a presentation made at the annual meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, on May 18.</p></li>
         <li class="forhover"><b>1943</b>- Died in the hotel New Yorker at the age of 86<br><p class="hidden">In early 1943, at age 86, Tesla died in a Hotel Room in New York. He died alone, and his body was found by a maid who ignored a do not disturb sign on Tesla’s room. The assistant medical professional evaluated the body and determined the cause of death was related to coronary complications. A few days after the FBI ordered for the acquisition of his belongings, John G Trump was called in to evaluate his works. Trump was a well known electrical engineer who worked for the state, which was held in custody. Following a three day investigation, a Trumps report concluded that was nothing that would demonstrate a hazard in unfriendly circumstances.</p></li>
